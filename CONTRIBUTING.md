## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Rasengan.js Templates project! Contributions can be in the form of new templates, bug fixes, documentation improvements, and more.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

I see, let's refine the "How to Contribute" section to accurately describe the branch naming convention provided by Better Commit CLI. Here's the updated guideline that includes the correct format for branch creation:

---

## How to Contribute

Contributing to this project involves several steps that help maintain the project's code quality and ensure that all changes are effectively tracked and managed. Please follow these detailed guidelines:

### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork the repository to your own GitHub account to create a personal copy where you can make changes independently of the original project.

### 2. Create an Issue
Before you make any changes, please create an issue on the GitHub repository detailing what you plan to fix or improve. This step helps avoid duplication of efforts and allows project maintainers to provide feedback before significant work begins.

### 3. Create a New Branch Using Better Commit CLI
After your issue is approved, you will need to create a new branch for your changes using the Better Commit CLI. This tool will prompt you to enter details to construct the branch name following the specific format:

```plaintext
<your-name>/<type-of-change>/<issue-tag>/<brief-description>
```

For example, if your username is `jdoe`, you are working on a new feature related to issue #42, and the feature involves adding a login page, you would enter:

```bash
better-commit branch "jdoe/feat/42-add-login-page"
```

This naming convention helps in tracking who made the change, what type of change was made, the specific issue it addresses, and a brief description of the change.

### 4. Commit Your Changes
Use the Better Commit CLI to commit your changes, which helps standardize commit messages and maintain a clean, understandable project history.

```bash
better-commit 
```

### 6. Push Your Branch to Your Fork
After committing your changes, push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request
Once you have tested your changes and are satisfied that they function as intended without introducing new issues, create a pull request from your branch to the `dev` branch of the specific template you are working on. This pull request will be reviewed by other developers who are also contributing to the same template.

### 8. Final Integration
After collaborative review and any necessary revisions, the changes in the `dev` branch can be merged into the `main` branch. This final integration is typically performed by a project maintainer to ensure all changes align with the project’s standards and goals.

By adhering to this structured approach, contributors can ensure their work aligns with the project’s goals and maintains high quality across the repository. Let me know if this version meets your needs or if there are further adjustments to make!


## Using Better Commit CLI

We use the Better Commit CLI to standardize commit messages and branch naming conventions. This ensures that our commit history is clean and easy to follow. Please follow these steps to install and use Better Commit:

### Installation

Install Better Commit globally via npm:
```bash
npm install -g better-commits
```

### Creating a Branch

When creating a new branch, use the structure provided by Better Commit:
```bash
better-commit branch
```

### Making a Commit

Use the Better Commit CLI to make your commits:
```bash
better-commit
```

For more details, refer to the [Better Commit documentation](https://github.com/Everduin94/better-commits).

## Design Patterns

To maintain consistency across our templates, we recommend following these design patterns:

### Container-Presenter Pattern

- **Container Components**: Handle state management and business logic.
- **Presenter Components**: Handle the rendering of UI elements.

### Atomic Design

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs).
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together (forms, cards).
- **Organisms**: Groups of molecules forming a distinct section (headers, footers).
- **Templates**: Page-level layout components.
- **Pages**: Specific views/screens in the application.

Certainly! Let's structure the Design Patterns section respecting the Atomic Design pattern. Here's how it should look:

---

Recommended project structure for templates following the Atomic Design pattern:

```
rasenganjs-examples/
├── templates
│   ├── template1
│   │   ├── components
│   │   │   ├── atoms
│   │   │   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── Input.tsx
│   │   │   │   └──...
│   │   │   ├── molecules
│   │   │   │   ├── Form.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── Card.tsx
│   │   │   │   └──...
│   │   │   ├── organisms
│   │   │   │   ├── Header.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── Footer.tsx
│   │   │   │   └──...
│   │   │   ├── templates
│   │   │   │   ├── Layout.tsx
│   │   │   │   └──...
│   │   │   └── pages
│   │   │       ├── Home.tsx
│   │   │       ├── Login.tsx
│   │   │       └──...
```

This structure adheres to the Atomic Design principles, organizing components into atoms, molecules, and organisms for better scalability and reusability.

## Stack-Specific Guidelines

### React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

#### React

- Use functional components and hooks.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Ensure components are reusable and maintain a single responsibility.

#### TypeScript

- Define clear types and interfaces.
- Use `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid using `any` type.

#### JavaScript


- Follow ES6+ conventions.
- Use `const` or `let` instead of var.
- Leverage asynchronous programming (e.g., Promises, async/await).

#### Tailwind CSS

- Use utility-first approach.
- Define custom themes in `tailwind.config.js`.
- Avoid using inline styles when Tailwind classes suffice.

## Bug Reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

### Guidelines for Bug Reports

1. **Validate and lint your code** to ensure the problem isn't due to a simple error.
2. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported.
3. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by reproducing it with the latest master or development branch.
4. **Isolate the problem** by creating a reduced test case and a live example (use [JS Bin template](https://jsbin.com)).

### Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report should be detailed and clear. Include the following:

- **Title**: Short and descriptive.
- **Summary**: The issue and the browser/OS environment.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. This is the first step.
  2. This is the second step.
  3. Further steps, etc.
- **Live Example**: A link to a reduced test case.
- **Additional Information**: Any relevant details such as code snippets and potential solutions.

Example:

```
Title: Error rendering component on Safari

Summary: The component crashes on Safari 14.0. The issue seems to be related to the use of optional chaining.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Safari 14.0.
2. Navigate to the component page.
3. Observe the crash.

Live Example: [JS Bin Link]

Additional Information: The error appears to be caused by optional chaining, which isn't fully supported in Safari 14.0. Removing optional chaining resolves the issue.
```

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

### Guidelines for Pull Requests

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. Fork the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:
    ```bash
    # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rasenganjs-examples.git
    # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
    cd rasenganjs-examples
    # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/rasengan-dev/rasenganjs-examples.git
    ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main
    ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
    ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these git commit message guidelines or your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project. Use Git's interactive rebase feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:
    ```bash
    git pull [--rebase] upstream main
    ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin <topic-branch-name>
    ```

7. Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description against the master branch and direct it to the `dev` branche.

### Important Notes

By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the MIT License.

## Semantic Git Commit Messages

Inspired by Sparkbox's awesome article on semantic commit messages. Please use the following commit message format:

- **chore** (updating npm tasks etc; no production code change) -> `git commit -m 'chore: commit-message-here'`
- **docs** (changes to documentation) -> `git commit -m 'docs: commit-message-here'`
- **feat** (new feature) -> `git commit -m 'feat: commit-message-here'`
- **fix** (bug fix) -> `git commit -m 'fix: commit-message-here'`
- **refactor** (refactoring production code) -> `git commit -m 'refactor: commit-message-here'`
- **style** (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change) -> `git commit -m 'style: commit-message-here'`
- **test** (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change) -> `git commit -m 'test: commit-message-here'`



Thank you for contributing! Your help is greatly appreciated.
